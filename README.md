# Minishell

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn about processes at a basic level by creating a "mini" shell.
This shell is very simple and doesn't need to contain complex functions like piping, redirection and so on.
It contains the following builtins:

```
cd
echo
env
setenv
unsetenv
exit
```

## Installation

```
$> make
$> ./minishell
```

Once in the shell, you can execute the builtins or any other simple command line that works on any other shell.
You can even call minishell from minishell!
